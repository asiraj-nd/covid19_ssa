# COVID-19 SSA, Early estimates of COVID-19 infections

This repository contains codes used in the preprint:

[Siraj AS, Worku A, Berhane K, Berhane Y, Siraj DS. 2020] (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20053421v2) - also in review.

All code contained within this repository is released under the [CRAPL v0.1 License](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/). 

====================

## code folder

The scripts in this folder run model simulations, generate results on a daily basis, summarize results into manageable tables, and postprocess results to perform further analyses. The simulation model is an implementation of a process based model structured in to Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed (SEIR) states.
The main model uses the Partially Observed Markov Process (POMP), with stochastic process model [King et al. 2016], and most parameters obtained from recent studies. 

* 0_numfunctions.R
* 0_snippet_setup.R
* 1_main_model_setup_simulation_output
* 2_generate_cumulative_infections_by_day_t
* 3_postprocess_cumulative_mortality_by_day_t


Each of the scripts in the folder should run in the order indicated starting with #1, #2 and #3. The two initial scripts header files, and are loaded automatically from within the three other.


## data folder

Data included here relate to the age pyramid obtained from Ethiopia [CSA, 2012], and age specific case fatality rates for China [The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020].


## outputs folder

This is where simulation and other processed data are stored. 


## plots folder

This folder contains figures output based on visualization scripts.
